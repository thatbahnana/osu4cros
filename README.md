# ü•Å osu4cros

*Probably* the only installer for osu!(lazer) on **ChromeOS**.
Install osu!(lazer) easily and quickly on your compatible device with a simple, automated script designed specifically for ChromeOS!

## üí° Please Note

**osu4cros** is designed to work **exclusively** within **Borealis**, the Steam environment for ChromeOS.
The Linux development environment, **Crostini**, does not provide the necessary performance or compatibility for osu!(lazer) ‚Äî especially in terms of touch input, audio, GPU acceleration, and overall responsiveness.

### Installing osu!(lazer) in Crostini often leads to:

* Poor performance: unstable framerate, broken audio, game running at √ó1.25 speed
* Hardware incompatibilities: no support for touch, stylus, or graphics tablet, unstable mouse behavior

<sup>\*These observations are based on my own testing using an Asus Chromebook Flip CX5500.</sup>

### In contrast, installing osu!(lazer) through Borealis generally provides:

* Full compatibility with touch, controllers, mouse, and graphics tablets\*
* Smooth and stable performance thanks to GPU acceleration inside Borealis

<sup>\*Graphics tablets work partially when applying the [recommended ChromeOS settings](/CONFIGURATION.md)</sup>

üí° **osu4cros makes the installation process clean, optimized, and effortless ‚Äî it automates everything and avoids complex, tedious steps.**

## üß© Requirements

  (Required to download osu!(lazer) and its dependencies)


## üì¶ Installation
